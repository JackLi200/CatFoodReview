p2,B0009YUI6I,AJD41FBJD9010,,5.0,"Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- there's a chicken version and a fish version. I'm really careful to keep on top of the literature about pet foods, and so I'm confident that this food meets a high standard. No yucky meat ""by-products"", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, in addition to a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.

On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!

Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture ""lifebits"" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.

I came across this cat food at the local Tractor supply (I was there to buy chicken feed!). I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.","01 23, 2009","tasty, human grade ingredients, unique manufacturing process",False

p2,B0009YUI6I,A19TO36EENEPDI,,5.0,"Bought this based on a friend's recommendation.  Our cats liked it very well and seemed to enjoy it.

One of our cats developed a urinary tract infection.  I don't think it was related to this food, but in any case, my husband bought Hill's Science Prescription Diet for Urinary Care from our vet.  The price was high.  I looked up Blue Buffalo Urinary Care Formula and saw that it was $63 for 6.5 pounds.  We love our cats, but that food costs more per pound than most of our food!  We've switched to Purina One Urinary Care formula and we'll see how this work.

p2,B0009YUI6I,A3JNZW40J3ZRCC,,1.0,"At first this dry food seemed great. My overweight adult cat leveled out in weight, and seemed to be eating less compulsively. (I get the impression from her reaction that this is a less tasty dry food - isn't all diet food?) But then we got a kitten, and she was eating this dry food too because we open feed the dry and combine with small servings of wet food. Eventually the kitten developed diarrhea, and I thought for sure it was the wet food. So I stopped serving them the wet food completely for three days, and the diarrhea actually got worse. So I tried the opposite, just feeding them wet food at intervals and removing the dry food completely (also for three days), and poof! Magically, no more diarrhea. Also, frankly, my overweight adult cat has not been losing any weight on this food. It helped her stop gaining weight initially, but she is still overweight and has stopped seeing any improvement for months. I've also noticed less vomiting from both cats since I stopped feeding them this dry food. So it's no longer having an effect from a weight loss perspective in my adult cat, and my kitten is having some kind of a reaction to it. Will not buy again, and looking for a different brand entirely for dry food replacement.

Also, I noticed that when my cats were eating this food they went through LARGE quantities of water. Multiple bowls each day. Apparently some vets recommend feeding only wet food (difficult when open-feeding) because it is better for kitty hydration. But I suspect that this particular dry food is a bit worse, because I did notice that my cats were going through far more water than they had on other brands of dry food.

I always keep an eye on my pets when I switch foods, and monitor their health. I keep an especially close eye on my male siamese mix, because he's very sensitive (his stomach and his sweet little heart). Normally I get the chicken adult cat food for both my cats. Last week I changed it up because I wanted to try this sensitive stomach mix. All week, my siamese boy has been eating less and playing less. He's been a bit of a recluse actually. Today, he started in with blood in the urine. Immediately, I took away the food. I have a whole bag of this stuff, but there's no way i'm going to give it to my cats any more. I've read other reviews where this particular brand/mix causes UTI's and crystalline plugs. I do believe this is what's going on with my siamese and his bloody urine.

I got some Newman's organic canned catfood that he could eat, until I could get him a vet appointment. Being the day before Thanksgiving, I have to just monitor him, give him lots of water, and keep his box clean. I'm going to ask my vet what food he recommends for my cats.

I still have the remains of a bad bag, but could never get anyone to test it, though I told them it burned the crap out of my hands when I touched it (which is how I realized this food was the cause of the incredible suffering I witnessed). the testing place wanted ten thousand dollars to do a full test, unless the test was requested by a vet, in which case it would be free. but every vet asked to request the test refused. and they all sold proctor and gamble products in their offices so, no surprise there. being told by attorneys that the cats were considered ""worthless property"" didn't help matters. and the whole thing turned me completely off ""premium bands.""

I switched to kirkland because there'd never been a recall, and used that for many years. but over the past few months the cats weren't eating it with their usual gusto. don't know if the recipe changed or what, but I freecycled the remaining bags (they went to another rescue group), and decided to try the blue buffalo. they love it! and the first thing I noticed was that after a few days suddenly Foxy Loxy wasn't leaving clumps of fur all over the house. that had been a regular occurrence every summer for her whole life. vets said it just something that happens with some cats.

it's been about a week now, and I'm very happy with the cats' reaction to this food. it's crazy expensive, but I don't mind working some extra overtime to keep them in good food. they're on the last cases of friskies canned food (which I've also been using because there have been no recalls), and I think I'll try the blue buffalo cans next.

One of our cats is a bit older and has a problem vomiting from a combo of sensitive stomach and eating too fast. This food has helped to lessen the times it happens! She has to eat less to fill up on enough nutrients, with the bonus of it being built for a sensitive tummy.

Another cat is our Bengal. They naturally have a bit of sensitivity in their stomachs. This food also has high-quality ingredients without an outrageous pricetag.

Our fluffy, lazy kitty will only eat specific brands... which is why we previously only bought Purina. He loves this stuff, without a doubt. The transition was so easy to switch to this food.

The fourth cat we have will eat everything and anything we out down for him. His opinion doesn't help this review much (haha), but what is important is how totally SOFT his fur is after a short time of feeding him Blue Buffalo.

p2,B0009YUI6I,A3M9Y79NV1HTNL,,1.0,"I have to join the bad reviews for this one as it made my cat's digestive problems worse. I used to feed him Taste of the Wild, which I get at a tractor supply shop, but I thought I'd ""upgrade"" him to better food and chose Blue Buffalo Sensitive Stomach because my cat does have occasional digestive issues.

Blue Buffalo Sensitive Stomach is more expensive than Taste of the Wild, but did not equate a better quality food!

He ate it for one month, and during that time he was fine at first, then began having dandruff and losing fur on his back legs! He seemed to be very itchy! As soon as I noticed the problem, I had a strong feeling it was the food. I spoke with a relative who is a vet, who said to switch the food and bring him in to her office if the problem didn't go away.

I switched him back to Taste of the Wild and his skin problems began clearing up within days.

We've determined he's allergic to grains. The ingredients in this food include grains: rice, oatmeal, barley. Cats are carnivores. Carnivores don't eat grains.

I think that many cats could do fine on this food if they don't have a grain sensitivity, but I understand the bad reviews and have to add my own. I am happy that other people like it, and that they're cats are doing well, but I can't recommend this food to anyone looking to switch to a ""good food."" This isn't worth the cost.

If your cat has a sensitive stomach, go with something grain free. Even if your cat doesn't have a grain allergy, it's just not something they should be eating (in my opinion). I wish I would have been more thorough and read the ingredients before purchasing.

For grain free: Taste of the Wild is great, or look at Blue Buffalo's ""Freedom"" line which does not include grain.","07 31, 2016",Not worth the cost: Cats aren't supposed to eat grain,True

Yes, it costs a bit more, but it's worth it.  A big bag lasts a month; cheaper food only lasts about 2.5-3 weeks.  Plus I know it's food that they can digest well and like.","07 31, 2016",Excellent kitty food!,True
