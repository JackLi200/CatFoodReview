This never happened with their old food. This is overpriced junk food for cats. The most notable thing is the quality of their coats. My cats used to have the softest coats and be the talk of anyone who came over ""I've never pet such soft cats!"" but they just feel average now.

The first time I got a bag of the Royal Canin it was recommended by the Vet for my elderly cat who has now passed on. All the cats liked it but it was hard for me to afford at the time so I switched back to whatever I was getting at Target at the time.
Then a few months ago I got a free bag of food at Petco so went with another small bag of the RC and let me tell you - I mixed it 1/2 and 1/2 with the other food since it was a smaller bag and my cats picked out the Royal Canin to eat and dropped the other food on the floor all around the bowl! At first I thought they were just being messy and every day I was picking up about a cup full of food off the floor, then I realized it was ONLY the (I think) purina which was mixed with the RC.

p5,B00068K5UQ,AUABJ7HTC0CLK,,5.0,"July of 2016, I was talked into adopting this adorable little puff ball of a cat. She was left in an apartment complex parking lot, and was all of 2 years old, and a tiny thing with huge feet.  Utterly adorable.  While my other cats had passed of old age, and I envisioned myself living a pet-free for a while... notsomuch once I met kitty.  Poor kitty came with a bag of Purina (egads!!) and because she's so darn fluffy, I knew we needed something special for her (hairball city!).  I tried Nutrish.  She looked at the bag and stared at me like ""Really, you adopted me for this?""  She wouldn't eat it...
I tried a couple different expensive brands (Orijin and blue buffalo I think it was - they were in the 30-40.00 a bag range) - BAM!  Kitty says NO.
Finally after a couple of days, she ate juuuust enough of the Origin to be a victim, yet postpone starvation. After we exhausted the 40.00 bag, I came home with the 32.00 bag of Royal Canin.  WOW.  I am ""warned"" each time the bowl is empty, so that bowl is filled every morning!
Hazel's (aka Puff Puff Kitty/P-Kitty) litter box is in a contained area in the garage, accessible by a cat door so there's no smell in the house - however, when I dump the box, there is near zero odor.  I use the Arm & Hammer litter, nothing outrageous - the kibble is THE difference.  Tiny poop, next to no smell.  The earlier two bags of cat food were not so kind to the nose...

The difference was noticible when a roommate moved in.  He had two older overweight cats eating meow mix.  Their fur was scruffy and I was stepping in vomit and hair balls daily.  The vomit was undigested piles of reddish meow mix food.  After switching them to this food no more vomit and or hair balls, their fur is soft and ""purty"". And even better yet their weight has become much healthier.  We feed free choice and not one of the cats is overweight even these two.

We also feed as a treat one 5.5 to 6 oz can of food a night for all five of them  to share as a treat.  We use Weruva, Wellness, Halo and occasionally other varieties.

I also would like to mention I fed my sixteen year old cat the Royal Canin kidney diet for cats after trying other brands this was the only one he would eat.  Between feeding Royal Canin dry, Wellness wet and supplementing with Azodyl he lived to the ripe old age of 19.

It was after seeing my other (then senior) cats prefer the prescription kidney diet over their regular diet that convinced me to completely switch to Royal Canin permantately.

As of right now my roommates cats are approximately 16 years old with no signs of kidney disease and my three guys are 2 years old and vibrant and healthy.

So I bought both brands for years.  That is until he developed an autoimmune condition and we had to remove almost all of his teeth. We had to switch to wet food and once again he would only eat  ""Friskies""  brand canned food and then we had to make a ""soup"" out of it so he could eat it.  So...to make a long story longer, he suddenly began eating the dry food I give my 5lb Maltese. ""Royal Canine"" food for mini dogs.  I couldn't keep him out of it.  He even tore into the bag to get to it.  I then decided to try ""Royal Canin"" for  cats  and ordered  "" Royal Canine feline health nutrition Indoor Mature 27 "".  Raja absolutely loves it and is beginning to turn his nose up at his ""soup""  I have no idea how he is eating it with only a few teeth but he can be heard crunching when he is at his bowl.

p5,B00068K5UQ,A2U61OLT76XK5I,,1.0,"I have been feeding my four cats Royal Canin brand foods (Indoor Light and  Adult, Intense Hairball, Oral Sensitive, and Hair and Skin), for years because of the quality of their food. Unfortunately, they have now decided that not only will they be adding by-products to their food but that we're so dumb we'll believe the only by-products they're going to add are good for our furry loved ones. They even had one of their own vets, Emmanuel Fontaine, produce a condescending flyer entitled ""Why we should not be afraid of chicken by products."" You can read this flyer at [...] or [...]

While the by-products they list in their flyer may have nutritional value, there is no promise from Royal Canin that they won't also be adding intestines, heads, feet and so on. According to the AAFCO, the following definitions constitute acceptable ingredients when listed as such:

Chicken/Poultry Meal (current main ingredient in their food): ""Poultry Meal is the dry rendered product from a combination of clean flesh and skin with or without accompanying bone, derived from the parts of whole carcasses of poultry or a combination thereof, exclusive of feathers, heads, feet, and entrails.""

Chicken/Poultry By-Product: ""Poultry By-Products must consist of non-rendered clean parts of carcasses of slaughtered poultry such as heads, feet, vicera, free from fecal content and foreign matter except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice.""

Chicken/Poultry By-Product Meal:""Poultry By-Product Meal consists of the ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered poultry, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs, and intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidably in good processing practices.""

Yummy, huh? I'm currently researching better foods to feed my babies. (As yet, the only Royal Canin products I can find that have by-products in them are their dog recipes, but I'm not waiting for them to cheapen their cat foods. I've switched my cats to Orijen 80/20 Cat and Kitten food.)

On May 14th I sent the following email to Royal Canin. Not surprisingly, they haven't responded. After you read their flyer, I would encourage you to do the same. Perhaps they'll change their mind.

I recently came across the February 1, 2013 article written by Emmanuel Fontaine, DVM, regarding the addition of chicken by-products to your pet foods.

Of the many reasons I feed my four cats Royal Canin, one primary is the absence of by-products. The inclusion of by-products has been and will always be the first thing that eliminates a food, and quite often the food company, from my shopping list and your article has not changed my opinion on this.

Yes, I read the entire article including the nutritional values you provided for each by-product that will be included. I also noted your all too equally balanced pie charts and my questions are:

1. Will the six items given in the article be listed as individual ingredients or will they simply be lumped into a single listing under the by-product label?

2. Are these six ingredients the only by-products being added or will there be additional by-products that have little, no or detrimental nutritional value?

3. If chicken meal and by-product meal are so equal in nutritional value, why not be more forthcoming in the ingredients listings on your packages instead of lumping them into a single item that can easily include just about anything else.

4. When you begin to include the aforementioned by-products in your pet foods, will you then remove the vitamins and minerals that you claim these by-products are supposed to provide? If you will not be removing the added vitamins and minerals from the ingredients, why?

5. Since, as you say, chicken brains, blood, bones, connective tissue, hearts and livers are so valuable to good nutrition, are you consuming them? Not your pets. You, your family? I certainly don't consume them, nor do I feed them to my family and by extension will not feed them to my beloved pets.

I very recently purchased three bags of Royal Canin - Indoor Light, Intense Furball and Special 33, part of my own blend of nutrition for my two Ragdolls, American shorthair and Norwegian Forest cat. I didn't know it would likely be my last.

Sincerely,
