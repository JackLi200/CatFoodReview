I have tried every dry food out there (picky boy will not eat wet food unless it is Gerber Chicken Baby Food, which settles his stomach but as a steady diet is not feasible).  Even gluten free, grain free, and a wide variety of proteins have produced nasty residuals that stain my carpets, floors, furniture, down comforters, etc. And he has tried exceptionally pricey ones from three different vets, all of which he liked but they didn't like him. It has been three weeks now with this product and the barfing has stopped completely.  The pellets are very small, a size he usually inhales without chewing (which adds to his predisposition to barf). However, he crunches away on this. The breeder told me to never buy any cat food available in a grocery store because the ingredients are not regulated; she used to work at a Purina cattery and has horrible horror stories about what gets thrown into the mix. So for 13 years it has been
Petsmart, Amazon, or the vets. I bought this product the first time in a pinch in the
grocery store. Surprise! He likes it and it likes him. And he is pooping Baby Ruths!
And even with the $4.99 shipping from a third party supplier to Amazon, it is still $13.28 less expensive through Amazon than at the grocery store; and of course having it delivered to my front door instead of lugging it 2 blocks from my parking garage is a bonus.","08 5, 2013",My Burmese show cat has been barfing for 13 years,True,2013-08-05

p4,B00BD76NZK,A1QZCWV5SXLS3O,,2.0,"I gave it 2 stars because the cats didn't hate it.
I have been wanting to switch our cats from eating Natural Balance LID, ever since the company was sold, and I noticed a big difference in quality of ingredients. It used to be just the best dry cat food, at a good price, and then gradually our cats started having more issues, like hairballs and vomiting, loose stools off and on, then last year 2 of our cats had seizures, and passed away 6 months from each other. We don't know why, but it definitely could have been the food.
Pet food companies are trying to keep their profits high, while offering grain-free formulas, at low cost. That has meant trying to get cheaper meat, and people having lost pets, to food contaminated with euthanasia drugs. I would rather my cats eat grain, than be poisoned by cheap meat, that is basically animals that were put down, then made into pet food. The FDA has lifted the penalties for companies that get caught breaking the laws that say you can't put meat in pet food from an animal that was put down, instead of slaughtered.
 I thought trying a big name middle ground pet food would be safer. I did what you have to do when switching foods, by just adding a little of the new food at a time, over about a month. I expected a bit of vomiting the first week, but they continue to have diarrhea, and it has meant them going outside the litter box several times. They do that to tell you that they feel sick. Haven't been able to switch more than half this food, and half their NB LID, after a month. I think I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and buy expensive dry food.
 If you have been feeding your cat dirt cheap grocery store cat food, this might be ok for your cat. But this isn't better than Natural Balance LID. Your cat won't have digestive issues when you switch them to a higher quality food than they have been eating, unless they are allergic to something in it, when done right. We already have one cat on prescription diet wet food, because the Natural Balance gave him urinary crystals and blockage. That shouldn't happen on high quality food. He won't eat the super healthy dry food you can get here off Amazon. It's not easy to find something that's good for them, they will eat, that doesn't cost a fortune, or come down to making them food by hand.

When my cat was younger, she could eat Purina indoor or meow mix cat food and be find; in her old age now nope she throws up after every meal and the vet doesn't know why (could be an allergy or a sensitive stomach) and this led me to trying every food I could think of to lessen this bulimic behavior in her. Finally, my mom comes home from a clearance bag of IAMS sensitive cat food, and I was thinking to myself ""here is another waste of time"" and long behold after a week on this food she does not puke up her food as much after eating (she still does occasionally, but that's because she has PICA). Now my issue is that all the stores near me no longer carry this formula in IAMS, and if they do it is the holy grail. So, thank goodness Amazon has it because I just bought a grain free IAMS food that my store did have and she has been throwing up after every bite for the last 2 hours....so here I am ordering it one day delivery from Amazon. This is a life saver....so if you have a bulimic older cat and have tried ever cat food out there (even the 40 dollar bag cat foods and wet foods) and have had no luck; then I recommend you give this cat food a try you may be thanking your lucky stars that you are no longer hearing that awful sound as often as you do now.

Omega-6 Fatty Acids, minimum 1.67%
Omega-3 Fatty Acids, minimum 0.17%

This food has 3,381 kcal/kg, or 288.06 kcal/cup.

Since l-carnitine is promoted as a reason to select this particular food, I will take a closer look at it.  It occurs naturally in meat, and extra is added to this food.

Do note, however, that high levels of l-carnitine probably aren't a good idea if your cat has hypothyroidism, as the study Carnitine is a naturally occurring inhibitor of thyroid hormone nuclear uptake in the Thyroid: Official Journal of the American Thyroid Association indicates that l-carnitine is an antagonist of thyroid hormone.  The abstract of this study states, At 10 mM carnitine, inhibition of T3 nuclear uptake was disproportionately higher, namely approximately 25% in neurons and 35% in hepatocytes. At 50 mM carnitine, there was a minimal additional decrease in whole-cell uptake of either hormone but a marked decrease in T3 nuclear uptake. The latter inhibition was approximately 60% in neurons and 70% in hepatocytes. We are aware of no inhibitor of TH uptake that has such a markedly different effect on the nuclear versus whole-cell uptake. Our data are consistent with carnitine being a peripheral antagonist of TH action, and they indicate a site of inhibition at or before the nuclear envelope.  That is of some concern to me, as overweight cats may, indeed, have hypothyroidism.
On the other hand, l-carnitine is probably beneficial if your cat has HYPERthryoidism and this disorder is far more common.  L-carnitine may help reduce some symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

L-carnitine may help your cat lose weight while maintaining lean muscle mass.  Research on this is still preliminary.  The study Dietary L-carnitine supplementation in obese cats alters carnitine metabolism and decreases ketosis during fasting and induced hepatic lipidosis states These results demonstrate the protective effect of a dietary L-carnitine supplement against fasting ketosis during obesity induction. Increasing the L-carnitine level of diets in cats with low energy requirements, such as after neutering, and a high risk of obesity could therefore be recommended.  Since fasting ketosis is a serious issue with cats who lose weight too rapidly, this is important.

Overall, Im not impressed with the amount of corn in this food.  I prefer the Iams ProActive Health Adult Hairball Care food, which has chicken and then chicken by-product meal as the top two ingredients.  This other formula has the same amount of l-carnitine as the reviewed food.  Indeed, all the Iams dry cat food I checked has the same amount of l-carnitine, though only some of them are actively promoted as having l-carnitine to help burn fat and maintain healthy metabolism.  To conclude, I think there are better Iams foods than this one.","05 24, 2016",Important info for cats with thyroid problems,False,2016-05-24

Occasionally I will try something more expensive, supposedly better, or even grain-free, and my cats will be gung-ho on eating the new cat food for a few weeks - then they lose interest in it. They want their Iams back. My oldest cat ate this most of her life and she almost made it to age 18. Even when her kidneys were failing she didn't want the prescription kidney diet, she wanted this....and at that stage my vet said it's better she eats the Iams than not eat at all.

As far as hairballs, this helps some. I also give Laxatone and I try to brush my Maine Coon daily, but she still has an occasional hairball but it's on the smaller side. This food works better at controlling hairballs than OTHER brands of hairball food I've tried that were twice the price.
