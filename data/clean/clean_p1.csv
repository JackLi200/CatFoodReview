I will be reordering.
-------------
This was purchased from Amazon since my grocery store has never carried this variety.  It is a mixture of mostly tan and reddish-brown crunchy kibble with VERY FEW teeny, tiny, itsy, bitsy pieces of those ""meaty tender morsels"" of chicken that you will need a magnifying glass and plenty of time to locate. No resemblance whatsoever to the photo.  Pfft.  Since cat-boy had a really bad digestive reaction to Purina's turkey kibble, and dog-boy got a severe yeast infection from their turkey morsel kibble (potatoes high on the ingredient list), I thought it best to stick to the chicken.

I called Purina and they took information from the bag to try and determine the source, use-by date etc.  I also contacted Amazon and they told me that the stinky bag I received was provided through Amazon directly, not another party, and has since been removed.  The bags now available for sale, as of the date of me writing this at least, are all from 3rd party sources and should be okay.  So, if you choose to buy it, you should be getting a quality bag and not have to worry about the stinky stuff.  Amazon also reimbursed me for the purchase.  Unfortunately I had poured the whole 16 lb. bag into my big storage container which had other good kibble in it as well.  Once I got the whiff, I ended up disposing of all the kibble in the container, including the good stuff, and thoroughly cleaning the container to be safe.

Not this time! Not only did my cat transition seamlessly and without any allergic reaction, she has been emptying her bowl. All of these years, she has been a grazer, eating here and there and leaving some food behind for later. She has been emptying her bowl and crying for more. She loved her new food so much and experienced such a seamless transition that Purina ONE Tender Selects Cat Food has become her new regular food.

I put out a bowl inside to see if my indoor cats would like it to, because $40-50 per 10lb bag of the food I was feeding them was becoming silly expensive. They voted with their tiny tummies, and this food won the day with a crushing victory.

I have a maine coon that weighs 15.6 lbs and he loves both the Chicken/Turkey and Salmon/Tuna. I have another domestic shorthair that I took in from being a stray when I found out she had FIV. She's gone up from a sick 6.0 lbs when I took her in to a healthy and happy 9.0 lbs eating the Chicken/Turkey and Tuna/Salmon.

And further, this actually smells like the cats enjoy it. I went vegetarian last year, and sometimes I get jealous of the cats as I'm scooping this out (I always keep 2 10lb airtight containers full of this) to feed them, and I'm almost tempted to have some.

Huge extra bonus, this is always on sale at my local supermarket, and while it is more expensive there vs. Amazon, it is still inexpensive vs other foods, and means I never have to worry about running low and having to scrounge for something else the cats will enjoy.

I do sometimes notice the food looks different from the supermarket vs. from amazon, but there seems to be no difference in smell, and the cats show no preference for amazon bought bags or store bought bags.","01 21, 2016",The strays rumble with happiness as soon as they see me step out onto ...,True,2016-01-21
