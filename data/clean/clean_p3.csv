p3,B000084DWM,ALJQR7WQZFZEY,,2.0,"I fed my cats Science Diet for years, until recently when I actually read the ingredients and did a little research.  Specifically, here are the first 7 ingredients of this food (full ingredients lists included below):
Chicken, Whole Grain Wheat, Corn Gluten Meal, Pork Fat, Powdered Cellulose, Chicken Meal, Wheat Gluten

Now compare the top 7 ingredients in Solid Gold Indoor Cat Chicken, Lentil, and Apple food:
Chicken, Chicken Meal, Lentils, Peas, Turkey Meal, Pea Protein, Pea Fiber

Which one looks healthier to you?  Here's a hint -- healthy cats do not need whole wheat, which is just an unnecessary (and cheap) carbohydrate filler, and gluten is not a good form of protein for cats and can actually cause digestive upset.  Powdered cellulose is added for fiber but is usually made from pine trees in cat food and is not healthy for cats in large quantities.  Now read the ingredients lists again.  Science Diet is about making profits with cheap ingredients, NOT making healthy cat food -- I gave it 2 stars only because at least it's made in the USA.  In fact, the excessive amount of wheat in Science Diet can actually prevent a cat from absorbing the actual nutrients in the food.  Solid Gold, on the other hand, is a holistic food that is wheat and gluten free and includes probiotics, which Science Diet does not.  They also have been around for over 40 years so must be doing something right.  After switching to Solid Gold my cats' fur went from dull and dry to shiny and soft, which to me is a good indication of overall better health and nutrition.  By the way, I've tried three different Solid Gold flavors with our guys and they absolutely LOVE them all.  I actually use the lower calorie version as a healthy ""treat"" for our cats and they devour it, and even a small bag is MUCH cheaper per pound than buying ""special"" treats that are often much less healthy.  Win win!

Now here's the kicker -- I did the math and this Solid Gold food is only 15% more expensive per pound than the Science Diet here on Amazon (using biggest bags available to compare).  That's not a lot folks, especially when it comes to your cat's health and well being, not to mention the potential to avoid costly vet bills later on.  I went with Solid Gold for its quality ingredients and relatively low cost, but there are several others that also look good (i.e. Merrick).

I took the time to write this because I wish I had known this information years ago and feel very guilty I haven't done better as a parent for my little loved ones, so I'm hoping this helps you make better decisions now.  Anyway, hope this helps and FYI here are the complete ingredient lists for both foods (notice where the fruits and vegetables fall on the list for each food):

Neither will touch the other's food. I don't know why this should be. She does seem to have more hairballs than he does. I brush them both.

I've used SD for many years, for many cats while doing rescue, unless a cat has a special need and something else is called for. I had one cat live to be 26. I have happy, healthy cats. I like that this does not have too much protein, and we don't seem to have too many kidney and renal issues on it. They can only metabolize so much, as they are domesticated.

Our cats are strictly indoors, with the closest of going outside being when we have the screens open during warm weather.  This is the perfect indoor cat food that doesn't have many kcals per cup (some of the other Hill's specialty foods have a lot more), which is good because indoor cats don't always get the most exercise.  We try to keep ours active and they enjoy chasing each other throughout the house, but I'm sure it's not as much exercise as an outdoor cat would get.  The kernels themselves are fairly large and odd shaped.  We have an automatic feeder for our one cat and the kernels come out fairly easy but will get stuck on occasion because of the odd shape.  I can't tell you how tasty the food is, but I'm guessing quite delicious since both of our cats have been eating this for a few years!

Since we have two cats, we typically buy the larger 15.5 lb. bag and it lasts us about two months.  The cats get fed 1 cup a day total between them, if that gives you an idea of about how much we go through in the two month time span.  With the last purchase on Amazon, we signed up for the automatic shipping, which has been great!  Not only do we get a discount on the price but we also don't have to think about ordering it when we get low!  Even without the automatic shipping discount, Amazon is still the cheapest place I have found to buy this food.  When the local pet stores have sales, I can find it for $30-32.

Overall, this is a great cat food that doesn't have many kcals, our cats love, and is decently priced on Amazon.  I would highly recommend this cat food to anyone looking to give their cat(s) a quality brand.","01 15, 2017",Quality Brand Cat Food at a Great Price,True,2017-01-15

I like Science Diet because it works.  It's not fancy but I feel it's a good quality food choice for my pets.

I caught her taking a piece out of her bowl, placing it on top of the wood feeder, and then eating it from there. This larger size causes some trouble for my cat, and I think she has a pretty normal-sized mouth. She's not small, at about ten pounds. It slows down the eating process a bit, which could be a good thing if you've got a cat that's a voracious eater. I just don't like seeing my cat struggle a bit with the size.

Riley is quiet and serene while Jessie is more boisterous and playful.  Jessie is much larger than Riley which is no surprise since she always gobbles her food as though shes starving and will consume Rileys leftovers.  When she was a kitten, Jessie was a garbage disposal with paws.  Nevertheless, Riley and Jessie are inseparable.  They are best friends.

  I must also say that Riley and Jessie are not finicky eaters.  They will eat any dry cat food.  In fact, I don't know of a brand that they won't eat.  Tammy once told me that dry cat food to cats is like potato chips to humans.  That got me worried.  We feed the girls some wet cat food for dinner and give them dry cat food during the rest of the day.  When the Amazon Vine Program offered me the Hills Science Diet Feline Cat Food, I jumped on it.  I wanted to give Riley and Jessie some healthy dry cat food.

  Also, I must say that Riley has had some problems with cleaning herself after defecating.  This has only begun happening in the past few months.  Tammy uses a sanitized hand wipe to clean away any feces that still remains stuck on her fur.  Fortunately, the girls love eating the Hills Science Diet Feline Cat Food.  Theyve been dining on it for two weeks and haven't experienced any adverse side effects from it such as vomiting or diarrhea.  In fact, Riley hasn't defecated on herself.  Her fur has been clean.

  I highly recommend buying the Hills Science Diet Feline Adult Multiple Benefit Cat Food as a healthy change to the regular dry cat food that you have probably been giving your cats.  It doesnt hurt to change their food every once in a while.  It is intended for households with multiple cats and/or multiple breeds.  It comes in a re-sealable bag.  However, because the precocious cats keep trying to get into bags, Tammy always dumps the dry cat food into a large plastic container that tightly seals.","04 19, 2016","My Girlfriends Two Cats, Riley and Jessie, Are Very Different and They Both Love Hills Science Diet Feline Cat Food!",False,2016-04-19
p3,B000084DWM,A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,,4.0,"We have two rescue cats that are approaching 6 years old.  Both survived poor odds when they were young kittens but when we decided to commit to giving them forever homes we took that promise seriously.  Our cats have been well treated and in return they have been the most loving companions imaginable.  We also have two outdoor kitties of about the same age who belong to our neighbor but spend most of their time in our yard because we have much more vegetation.  They are 24/7 outdoor cats that we don't feed but they are wonderfully healthy.

Our own cats eat better than average wet and dry food on a managed feeding cycle but we don't fall for the hype of gourmet foods  most of that hype is part of a billion dollar industry to manufacturer cheap product (usually offshore) and sell it for a premium price using fancy names and promises.  We have used Science Diet before but we don't put any kind of faith into it being anything more than cat food. I do give them kudos that they manufacturer their product in the United States, though.

Whats in this product may not be the most premium (and not everyone can afford the most expensive) but it is better than no-name brands. Any cat owner will know that some cats will like the taste immediately and others may take time to warm up to it, while some picky eaters won't like it at all. There is no way to predict any pros or cons in terms of long-term effects on an animals health as that will differ on a per-cat basis.

All in all the product comes from a respectable source, is manufactured in the U.S. and in my case my case like the taste and have yet to throw it up. That rates as a 4-star product following Amazons guidelines.","04 18, 2016",Somewhere in the middle overall,False,2016-04-18
